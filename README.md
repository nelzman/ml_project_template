## 1 Goals
This repo is a gathering of implementation standards that can be the starting point for different implementations.  
There are multiple implementations that will be added step by step:
1. Python:
    - infrastructure:
        - environment yml: done
        - ci-pipeline yml: done
        - package-building: tbd
    - Implementation of training for:
        - regression: done
        - classification: tbd
        - clustering: tbd
        - computer vision
            - cnn: tbd
            - yolo: tbd
        - nlp: 
            - sentiment: tbd
        - genai:
            - rag: tbd
    - Implementation of Azure-ML usage:
        - experiments/jobs: done
        - mlflow-logging: done
        - environment-creation: done
        - compute-usage: done
        - model-registry: done
    - Implementation of AWS Sagemaker usage: tbd
    - unit-tests: tbd
2. R:
